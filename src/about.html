      <h2>What is the purpose of this site?</h2>
      <p>This website is intended to bring light to the risk of 51% attacks on
      smaller cryptocurrencies. It is not intended to encourage or help in
      completing an attack, but instead to get people talking about the
      problem and potential solutions.</p>
      <h2>What is a 51% attack?</h2>
      <p>In Proof of Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies, nodes typically are set up to
      recognize the blockchain with the most blocks (and therefore the most
      hashing power) as the correct version of history. Miners with > 50% of
      the network hashing power can take advantage of this by sending funds to
      one address on the main chain, while sending the same funds to another
      address on a forked copy of the blockchain that they are silently mining
      with more hashing power than the main chain.</p>
      <p>Since other nodes only know about the main chain, they will see the
      first transaction as valid, and exchanges, etc will accept this
      transaction as valid. This malicious node can later release these
      silently mined blocks, and other nodes will accept this as the new
      'correct chain' since it is longer. This will cause the original
      transaction to effectively dissappear, and nodes will recognize the funds
      as being sent to the address from the new chain instead. This is known as
      a 'double spend' attack.</p>
      <p>Most bigger cryptocurrencies have sufficient mining capacity behind
      them, making it extremely expensive to acquire the necessary
      hardware to pull an attack like this off. Smaller cryptocurrencies have
      less hashing power securing the network, making it possible to simply
      rent hashing power from miners on a service like <a target="_blank"
                                    href="https://www.nicehash.com/">Nicehash</a>
      for a few hours. This significantly reduces the capital costs of an
      attack.</p>
      <p>Recently there have been a number of 51% attacks including a <a
                                                          target="_blank"
                                                          href="https://qz.com/1287701/bitcoin-golds-51-attack-is-every-cryptocurrencys-nightmare-scenario/">high
                                                          profile attack</a>
      against Bitcoin Gold where $18 Million was stolen.</p>
      <h2>How is the attack cost calculated?</h2>
      <p>Using the prices NiceHash lists for different algorithms we are able
      to calculate how much it would cost to rent enough hashing power to match
      the current network hashing power for an hour. Nicehash does not have
      enough hashing power for most larger coins, so we also calculated what
      percentage of the needed hashing power is available from Nicehash.</p>
      <p>Note that the attack cost does not include the block rewards that the
      miner will receive for mining. In some cases this can be quite
      significant, and reduce the attack cost by up to 80%.</p>
      <h2>Can we reduce the risk?</h2>
      <p>There are a number of possible solutions to this problem:
      <ul>
        <li>PoS</li>
        <li>Coins built on top of other networks (ERC20)</li>
        <li>Interchain linking</li>
